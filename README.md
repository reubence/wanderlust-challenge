##  Fixed Bugs

| Bug                                                       | Description                                                                                | Fix                                                                                                    |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Redundant `setQuery` in `onSubmit`**                    | The query state was being manually set even though it was already controlled by the input. | Removed unnecessary `setQuery(e.target.query.value)` from the submit handler.                          |
| **"No results found" displayed prematurely**              | Message appeared before the user even performed a search.                                  | Used a `hasSearched` flag and validated `results.length === 0` before showing the message.             |
| **No error feedback on failed search**                    | Users got no feedback if the search API failed.                                            | Introduced `setSearchError` to capture and display errors in the UI.                                   |
| **Voice search didn't handle mic access failure**         | No user alert if mic permission was denied or recording failed.                            | Wrapped recording logic in `try-catch` and showed a user-friendly alert.                               |
| **Audio recording duration undefined**                    | Recording continued indefinitely.                                                          | Capped recording to 3 seconds using `setTimeout`.                                                      |
| **Transcription response lacked error handling**          | No error displayed if the transcript was empty.                                            | Added fallback alert if `data.transcript` is missing.                                                  |
| **React hook used in a server component**                 | `useState` used in a file treated as a server component.                                   | Added `"use client";` at the top of `page.tsx`.                                                        |
| **Environment variable missing**                          | `GOOGLE_API_KEY` not set, causing Zod validation failure.                                  | Added `.env` validation and error handling.                                                            |
| **Incorrect Google GenAI usage**                          | Used invalid methods from `@google/genai`.                                                 | Switched to using `@google/generative-ai` and base64 audio conversion.                                 |
| **`next` not recognized as internal or external command** | Command line failed due to Next.js conflict with libraries.                                | Downgraded `react` and `react-dom` to resolve version conflict with `date-fns` and `react-day-picker`. |
| **Typo in `db.queryRaw`**                                 | Misspelled method as `db$queryRaw`.                                                        | Corrected to `db.$queryRaw`.                                                                           |
| **TypeScript error in `searchSchema`**                    | `query` field was not included in the Zod schema.                                          | Added the `query` field to the `searchSchema` for proper validation.                                   |

##  UX & Functional Improvements

| Improvement                                          | Description                                                                |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Disabled input & button during loading/recording** | Prevents multiple submissions and improves feedback.                       |
| **Enhanced error display**                           | Clear messages shown on search/transcription failure.                      |
| **Loading indicators added**                         | UI feedback via spinner icons from `lucide-react`.                         |
| **Auto-search after transcription**                  | Automatically triggers search once voice is transcribed.                   |
| **Flexible transcription input**                     | Voice input dynamically sets the query, reducing user effort.              |
| **Responsive UI**                                    | Added conditional rendering and loading states to improve visual feedback. |

##  API Improvements

### `/api/search`

* **Input Validation**: Prevented empty queries before running Zod validation.
* **Database Query Update**: Switched from searching `description` to `location` field.
* **Debug Logging**: Logged incoming queries and results.
* **Error Response Standardization**: Included `status`, `message`, and `error` in failure responses.

### `/api/transcribe`

* **Environment Validation**: Used `zod` to validate required environment variables.
* **Audio Processing**: Converted audio to base64 format before sending to the Google API.
* **Improved Transcription Handling**: Extracted transcript safely and returned fallback message if it failed.
* **Better Logging**: Logged incoming audio requests and Google API responses for debugging.

---

##  Backend Changes Summary

* Rewrote parts of the Prisma query to support case-insensitive location matching.
* Implemented early returns for invalid input in API routes.
* Added seed data to ensure test queries like “Tokyo” or “Japan” produce valid results.

---

##  Voice Search Workflow

1. User clicks the mic button.
2. App records 3 seconds of audio.
3. Audio is sent to `/api/transcribe`.
4. Transcription result is set in the search box.
5. Auto-triggered search displays destination results.

---

##  Code Quality Enhancements

* Consolidated error boundaries and try/catch logic.
* Refactored button behavior for consistent UI state.
* Improved conditional rendering to reduce false "no results" messages.
* Used `zod` schemas throughout for consistent validation on both client and server.
